# Native Plugin for ARFoundationReplay

There are two native plugins for ARFoundationReplay:

- Avfi: Based on keijiro's [Avfi](https://github.com/keijiro/Avfi) and modified to record/playback metadata.
- XR native plugins: If you want to build this, download the [XR SDK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xr-sdk.html) and put Header folder into `./Headers`.
